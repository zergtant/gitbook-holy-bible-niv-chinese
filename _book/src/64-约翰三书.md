## 约翰三书第1章
约叁1:1
> The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
>
> 作长老的，写信给亲爱的该犹，就是我诚心所爱的。


约叁1:2
> Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.
>
> 亲爱的兄弟啊，我愿你凡事兴盛，身体健壮，正如你的灵魂兴盛一样。


约叁1:3
> It gave me great joy to have some brothers come and tell about your faithfulness to the truth and how you continue to walk in the truth.
>
> 有弟兄来证明你心里存的真理，正如你按真理而行，我就甚喜乐。


约叁1:4
> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
>
> 我听见我的儿女们按真理而行，我的喜乐就没有比这个大的。


约叁1:5
> Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you.
>
> 亲爱的兄弟啊，凡你向作客旅之弟兄所行的，都是忠心的。


约叁1:6
> They have told the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
>
> 他们在教会面前证明了你的爱。你若配得过　神，帮助他们往前行，这就好了，


约叁1:7
> It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans.
>
> 因他们是为主的名（原文作“那名”）出外，对于外邦人一无所取。

约叁1:10
> So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, gossiping maliciously about us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.
>
> 所以我若去，必要提说他所行的事，就是他用恶言妄论我们。还不以此为足，他自己不接待弟兄，有人愿意接待，他也禁止，并且将接待弟兄的人赶出教会。


约叁1:11
> Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
>
> 亲爱的兄弟啊，不要效法恶，只要效法善。行善的属乎　神，行恶的未曾见过　神。

> --
>
> 愿你平安。众位朋友都问你安。请你替我按着姓名问众位朋友安。
